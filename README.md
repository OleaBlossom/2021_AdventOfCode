# 2021_AdventOfCode

I'm participating in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) again in 2021, this time using Java (the language we're using in school). Thanks to TheTurkeyDev for [streaming his Day 1 solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd95nb8pA6E) and [posting his setup to github](https://github.com/TheTurkeyDev/Advent-of-Code-2021) so I could jump straight into solving the puzzles.

Day 1: practice for-loop, import ArrayList  
Day 2: implement foreach loop, split on space, parse string as int
